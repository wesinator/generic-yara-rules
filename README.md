A few YARA rules to detect generic characteristics in Windows PEs that may indicate maliciousness.

**NOTE:** Please do not make copies of these rules into other larger rule collections. Forking and using them is fine, I just don't want duplicate copies that aren't tied back to the original repo.
If you want to incorporate these rules into a larger collection, use [Git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
